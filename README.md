## Title Abstract


As a Data Engineer I am often tasked with taking Machine Learning and Deep Learning models into production, sometimes in the cloud and sometimes at the edge.  I have developed Java code that allows us to run these models at the edge and as part of a sensor/webcam/images/data stream.  I have developed custom interfaces in Apache NiFi to enable real-time classification against MXNet models directly through the Java API or through DJL.AI's Java interface.   I will demo running models on NVIDIA Jetson Nanos and NVIDIA Xavier NX devices as well as in the cloud.

 

# Technologies Utilized:

# Apache MXNet, DJL.AI, NVIDIA Jetson Nano, NVIDIA Jetson XAVIER, Apache NiFi, MiNIFi, Java, Python.
